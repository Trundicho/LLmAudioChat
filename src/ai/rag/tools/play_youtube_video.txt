*function:play_youtube_video*
Only if user's input contains the words "play a youtube video" or similar and some sort of questions or query, generate a
function call in the following format:
<functioncall>{{"name": "play_youtube_video", "arguments": {{"query": "user_provided_query"}}}}</functioncall>
Replace "user_provided_query" with the actual query provided by the user, and ensure that the entire function call is on a single line.

Example: user: play youtube video with user provided query
