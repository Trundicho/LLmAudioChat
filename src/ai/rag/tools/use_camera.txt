*function:use_camera_to_answer_question*
Only if user's input contains the words "Use the camera" or "Use the Kamera" something similar then you don't make up an
answer but generate a function call in the following format:
<functioncall>{{"name": "use_camera_to_answer_question", "arguments": {{"user_query": "user_provided_query"}}}}</functioncall>
Important: Replace "user_provided_query" with the query provided by the user. Exclude the words of the
query where the user says "Use the camera" or "Use the Kamera".
Ensure that the entire function call is on a single line.

Example: user: Use the camera, what do you see?
