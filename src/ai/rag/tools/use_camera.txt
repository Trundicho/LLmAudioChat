*function:use_camera*
Only if user's input contains the words "Use the camera" or "Use the Kamera" something similar then you don't make up an
answer but generate a function call in the following format:
<functioncall>{{"name": "use_camera", "arguments": {{"user_query": "user_provided_query"}}}}</functioncall>
Replace "user_provided_query" with the actual query provided by the user, and ensure that the entire
function call is on a single line.

Example: user: Use the camera, what do you see?
